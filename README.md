# SuperTokens SSO Demo

The purpose of this project is to provide a working demo of SSO using SuperTokens.

The project was developed with Angular and Firebase. It is based on https://github.com/dleangen/supertokens-demo-1.

I have not tested the demo in production, using real domain names. Rather, it has
only been tested on localhost.

Please see this article for details: [TBD]
